                <h4>Udta Kerala: How state's drug crisis could be worse than Punjab's</h4>
                <img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202503/kerala-drug-081351156-16x9_0.jpg?" alt="">
                <p>The sound of alarm bells has reached a deafening crescendo in Kerala as a drug epidemic breaches the walls of its schools and shatters the peace of its homes. Narcotics have infiltrated every corner of the state, leaving a trail of violence and despair. From the chilling confession of a son who killed his mother, blaming her for his very existence, to sexual abuse of siblings, cases of drug-fuelled violence have soared.Kerala -- hitherto not present on India's narcotics map -- might be facing a crisis worse than that in drug-plagued Punjab. In 2024, 24,517 cases were registered in Kerala under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, which deals with narcotics. For Punjab, the number stood at 9,734.</p>

                <p>"We have reached a stage where the state Assembly had to suspend its regular business to consider this social menace. The session was suspended to consider this issue because it has now reached the schools. This is the reality we have to deal with. We have been pushing it off saying that in Kerala it is not happening," Kerala High Court Justice VG Arun said recently.</p>


<p>Finding a seller is no longer difficult. As Kerala’s Leader of the Opposition pointed out, one could get the choice of drugs within 15 minutes of placing an order. Gangs are using superbikes for faster deliveries.Most transactions are faceless and involve the dark web and cryptocurrencies as well. Offline, the police identified around 1,300 drug-peddling blackspots in Kerala.Where are the drugs reaching Kerala from, and when did the situation turn this bad? And how has a state, otherwise known for its idyllic locales and progressive politics, come into such a deadly grip of narcotics?India Today Digital is trying to answer the above questions and more after talking to police officers, experts and going through several reports and discussions.</p>

<p>
    WHICH ARE THE DRUGS AND WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM?
    Traditional cannabis joints and injectables, though still in use, have been largely replaced by synthetic drugs crystals and MDMA -- also known as Ecstasy or Molly.Among the contraband seized in Kerala, MDMA tops the list alongside cocaine, hashish, brown sugar, and heroin. It is reported that MDMA has seen a jump of over 65 per cent in one year.

<p>ALARMING NUMBERS POINT TO DRUG CRISIS IN KERALA
In the first month of 2025, Kerala saw about 2,000 NDPS cases. The number of cases registered in 2024 was 24,517, while in 2023 it was 30,697.
Over the past four years, the state has recorded 87,101 drug-related cases, leading to 93,599 arrests.In contrast, the four years preceding this period saw 37,228 cases and 41,378 arrests, according to data presented in the state assembly by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Vijayan, however, argues that the rising number of cases is evidence of Kerala's effective crackdown and robust anti-narcotic measures.“Kerala’s conviction rate stands at 98.19 per cent, significantly higher than the national average of 78.1 per cent and surpassing most other states,” he told the Assembly.Opposition leaders and experts do not subscribe to his views.</p>
